'''
Write a program that works out whether if a given number is an odd or even number.

Even numbers can be divided by 2 with no remainder.

e.g. 86 is even because 86 ÷ 2 = 43

43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.

e.g. 59 is odd because 59 ÷ 2 = 29.5

29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. 
Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.

# 🚨 Don't change the code below 👇
number = int(input("Which number do you want to check? "))
# 🚨 Don't change the code above 👆

#Write your code below this line 👇
if number % 2 == 0:
    #print(f"{number} is even")
    print("This is an even number.")
else:
    #print(f"{number} is odd")
    print("This is an odd number.")
